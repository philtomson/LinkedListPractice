Linked List Excercises

I use a lot of higher level languages like Ruby, Javascript &
OCaml.  It's easy for your C++ knowledge to get rusty if you're
not using the language.

The goal here is to keep my C++ chops up to date by practicing
with linked lists.  Linked lists offer good practice in pointer
manipulation.  They also very often appear in interview 
questions ;-)
