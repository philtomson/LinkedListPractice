Linked List Excercises

I use a lot of higher level languages like Ruby, Javascript &
OCaml.  It's easy for your C++ knowledge to get rusty if you're
using higher level languages that tend to do a lot of things like
memory management for you.  

The goal here is to keep my C++ chops up to date by practicing
with linked lists.  Linked lists offer good practice in pointer
manipulation.  They also very often appear in interview 
questions ;-)

The other idea here is to offer variations on the theme of linked lists.

to compile:
g++ -o list list.cpp
